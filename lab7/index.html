					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The biggest challenge I had with this lab was running my function in the console.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had an issue with accidentally capitalizing a letter that shouldn't have been capitalized, but I finally saw it and then the fuction worked.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall this lab went ok, I had some minor issues which I was able to fix and then I learned that the existing function just put capital letters first, so I tried the same name lower-cased and it sorted correctly.</p>
