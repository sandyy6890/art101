					<h2>About Me</h2>
					<p>I was born and raised in South Lake Tahoe, CA. Halloween is by far my favorite holiday, and I also was a fall baby and a libra. I'm really into astrology. I have a dog named Gus who is six years old. I love to make art, mostly in the form of physical art like drawing, painting, collaging, and print-making. I also love to spend time with my loved ones and explore nature and new cities, and also listen to live music.</p>
