			<h1>Lab 2 - HTML and CSS Starter</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenges I ran into with this lab was with remembering all the intricacies of writing the html, indenting properly, and using the correct symbols</and>.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>The main problems that arose during this lab were with work-flow and getting the hang of linking css files, creating new html files, etc. I fixed these by talking them through with my partner and also looking really closely at student examples and the index files provided in the art101 repository.</p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>I put a lot of energy into getting this lab right. It was frusterating at times, esspecially when I would run into difficult problems that took longer for me to notice my errors. Overall though, I'm proud of myself for completeing it and ultimately pretty happy with the result and with my effort. </p>

					<p>            <h1>Hello World</h1>
						<p>My name is Sandy Strishak. I am a third year Art and Sociology double major. 
							My favorite medium lately has been print-making, although painting and drawing 
							also hold a special place in my heart. I also write poetry sometimes! I am 
							interested in helping people through art and activism when I graduate and to do 
							that I'm planning on attending graduate school. I also love animals of all 
							kinds--especially dogs and reptiles, and I have a golden-retriever mix named Gus. 
							Finally, I have absolutely no coding experience yet.</p></p>
