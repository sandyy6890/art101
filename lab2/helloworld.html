            <h1>Hello World</h1>
            <p>My name is Sandy Strishak. I am a third year Art and Sociology double major. 
                My favorite medium lately has been print-making, although painting and drawing 
                also hold a special place in my heart. I also write poetry sometimes! I am 
                interested in helping people through art and activism when I graduate and to do 
                that I'm planning on attending graduate school. I also love animals of all 
                kinds--especially dogs and reptiles, and I have a golden-retriever mix named Gus. 
                Finally, in terms of coding experience, I have absolutely none.</p>
