			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem-solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge I had with this lab was writing the pseudocode in words a computer would understand and also including the write amount of detail. </p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I didn't really have any notable problems with this lab. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this lab went pretty well. It was difficult to start thinking in java script comments rather than conversational English because I've never done it. </p>

					<p> Implementation of the Cows and Bulls game
						Author: Sandy Strishak and Panetha Jayakumar
						Date 17 October 2024

						A psuedocode for Cows and Bulls Game:
						1. Get the number of letters as input, with any value between 3 and 8.
						2. Get the number of attempts allowed as input, with any value between 8 and 25.
						3. Get the number of player(s) involved in the game as input. 
						4. Generate the random word based on the number of letters input.
							4.1 If one player, the computer is prompted to generate a word with a word length equal to the number of letters input. 
							4.2 If two or more players are involved, prompt to select the player who needs to select or enter a random word. The selected player will now be prompted to select or enter the word of his choice, which should be validated to match the number of letters input.
						5. Get a word guess as input with restricted word length.
						6. Assess the guessed word with the word chosen.
						7. Prompt the player stating the number of cows and bulls.
						8. If 4 bulls, the player who guessed correctly wins.8.1 Generate a prompt to display 'Winner is Player X' and proceed to the step 10. 
						9. Otherwise, steps 5-7 are repeated until the word guessed has 4 bulls. 9.1 If the number of attempts has been reached, generate a prompt 'Player X Lost. No more attempts available. The correct word is XXX' and proceed to step 10.
						10. Generate a Prompt with options for a new game or a new word or to end the game.10.1 If new game is chosen, repeat from step 1.10.2 If new word is chosen, repeat from step 4.10.3 If exit is chosen, close the console.</p>
