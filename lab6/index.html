			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The main challenge I had with this lab was understanding the instructions correctly.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>I had a problem with the js syntax when I was experimenting in the console, I then asked my TA and found out that I didn't have to do what I was trying to do for the assignment and that I actually had it right.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>Overall, this assignment went pretty smoothly, all the js language and conventions are very new, but I think I'm slowly catching on. I also put a lot of effort into this lab. </p>

					<h2>Results</h2>
